1. Description
--------------

gynter.github.io provides a simple responsive Jekyll template using 
Bootstrap, jQuery and Font Awesome. It also contains the content of my 
homepage <http://kyber.kits.ee>.

The Jekyll configuration is defined and documented in `_config.yml`. 
Some parts of the web like navigation menu (`_includes/navbar.html`) 
are hardcoded into the template.

Thanks to Michael Lanyon for [tags alphabetizing code](http://blog.lanyonm.org/articles/2013/11/21/alphabetize-jekyll-page-tags-pure-liquid.html).
